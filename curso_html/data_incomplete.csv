Tequila Cocoa Caliente	Tequila	Sweet	Chocolate	Pepper	Ingredients: For the Cinnamon-Serrano-Infused Tequila:, 1 (750-milliliter) bottle aged tequila, 2 cinnamon sticks, 1 whole serrano pepper >For the Cocktail: 1 cup milk, 2/3 tablet Mexican table chocolate, about 1 ounce, 1 1/2 ounces cinnamon-serrano reposado tequila, Cinnamon stick, for garnish, Chili pepper, for garnish >Make the Cinnamon-Serrano Tequila: Fill an infusion jar with reposado or añejo tequila and add two cinnamon sticks. After one day, do a taste test to check the flavor and continue infusing if you'd like it to be a little stronger. It should take no more than two or three days. Once the cinnamon is where you like it, add one serrano pepper. This infusion should only take a few hours. Any longer and you risk burning the tequila, making it undrinkable. Test it often until it reaches your preferred level of spice. When the tequila has the ideal flavor blend for you, remove the cinnamon and pepper. Rebottle, label, and store as you would any other tequila. >Make the Tequila Cocoa Caliente: Gather the ingredients. In a small saucepan, heat the milk over medium-low heat. Add the chocolate after you see the first bubbles form. Stir continually until the chocolate melts, keeping the heat moderate. You do not want the milk to come to a boil. Add the tequila and whisk until a light froth is formed. Pour into a warmed mug and garnish with either a cinnamon stick or, for a little extra spice, a small, whole chili pepper.
